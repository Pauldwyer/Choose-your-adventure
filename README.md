## Validator Testing 

Code Institue recomended using the PEP8 Python Validator to to validate the code written for this project.

This site is no longer active so the below steps were taken to validate the code for this project.

A PEP8 validator was added to my Gitpod Workspace by following these steps.

1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle  Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
2. In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
4. Select pycodestyle from the list.
5. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

See below images of problems found after installing the above PEP8 workaround.
