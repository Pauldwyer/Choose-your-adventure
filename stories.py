    'Dont hurt her' you shout
    'Get back or else' you yell at the stranger
    The stranger slowly steps towards you
    He has a blade in one hand and a blackjack in the other
    You turn to Emily and say 'Everything will be ok baby'
    You turn again back to the stranger, he is edging closer slowly
    'What do you want' you scream
    'You must pay for your transgressions' says the stranger in a lowly growl
    You quickly grab the clock off the fireplace and you charge the stranger
    You swing with all your strength aiming for his head
    But he is too fast, he side steps your attemp
    and cracks you across the head with the blackjack
    You pass out

    You awake and find a bloody blade in your hand
    You throw it across the floor, your hand is covered in blood
    You look up and scan the room, you see Emily on the floor
    She is covered in blood
    The door opens and Emilys father walks in
    'What in the seven hells have you done' he shouts

    *Crack*

    You awake with a splitting headache, you are back in the forest clearing
    Your tied up against the tree
    5 men looking down on you
    You recognise Emilys father Pierre
    'You thought you could runaway' he says
    'Now you will die for what you did to my daughter'
    'Do you have any last words {username} ?'
    As you open your mouth to protest Pierre slashes our throat
    You bleed to death tied to the tree

    You take off running in the direction of the seagul noises
    You forget the pain in your feet

    The hair starts to stand on the back of your neck.
    Oh {username} what have you done?
    You have a feeling you are being chased
    Why are you running?
    What did you do?
    Why were those people so angry??
    You start to remember a little about the chase

    '{username} you murderer get back here and face justice'

    Suddenly you are back in the current moment
    The trees start to become less dense
    You star to smell salt water
    You can hear waves crashing in the distance
    You start to run faster
    But your feet are screaming at you


    Finally you come out of the woods into a little hidden beach
    You start to hear a voice singing, it sounds like a angel
    You dont understand the words or language
    But the sound makes you want to get closer to it
    You can scan the beach
    You see somebody on the rocks at the far end
    That has to be a lady singing

    You decide to go deeper into the woods
    You need to find somewhere to rest

    You walk deeper and deeper into the woods
    The only sound you hear is twigs and branches crushing under your feet

    How did you get into this situation
    You cant remember what happened 5 hours ago
    Oh {username} what have you gotten yourself into this time.

    But you start to remember some things
    You start to get lost in your thoughts

    You remember jumping out the window
    You remember Pierre shouting murderer at you
    Who did you kill??
    And why was your wives father calling you murderer??
    Why did Pierre and his 4 brothers chase you out of the village??

    You snap back into reality
    You have never been this deep into the woods
    Surely you are near the foot of the Everlook mountain
    You are actually and whats that ahead?
    Is that a cave in the foot of the mountain?
    Do you hide in the cave or keep going through the woods?

    You set out crossing the beach
    The smell of the salt water filles your nose
    The wind blows sand up into your face
    You look out across the sea
    Is there a way here to escape this nightmare?
    You get closer to the rocks
    The song the person is singing is hypnotizing
    You have no idea what language
    But it is the sweetest song you have ever heard
    You get closer to the person and realise it is a woman
    She has her back to you
    She dosent hear you approach, atleast dosent show it
    The singing gets louder
    You now feel compelled to walk towards her
    '{username} come closer'
    You now feel compelled to walk towards her
    As if your brain is not controlling your body
    Something else is controlling your body
    Your legs walk with a mind of there own
    All you can think about is the voice singing the song
    You are now around 3 metres away from the woman
    Golden blonde hair dangles down her back
    In a pale white dress
    Sleek slender shoulders
    Is this an angel from heaven?
    She turns and glances over her shoulder at you
    You can only see her green eyes, shoulder hiding her face
    She turns to face you
    You can still hear the singing in your ears
    But her mouth isnt moving!
    You are fozen in time, you cant move!
    Your eyes look to her hands, they are claws!
    She laughs and you see her mouth is full of fangs!
    She disappears into a puff of smoke
    The song is ringing in your ears

    You feel her presence behind you
    'Just in time' she whispers in your ear
    'I was starting to get hungry'
    She sinks her fangs into your neck
