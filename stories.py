    This is the bad ending, which means you died.

    Tough luck {username}

    Maybe rethink your choices and play again?

    'Dont hurt her' you shout
    'Get back or else' you yell at the stranger
    The stranger slowly steps towards you
    He has a blade in one hand and a blackjack in the other
    You turn to Emily and say 'Everything will be ok baby'
    You turn again back to the stranger, he is edging closer slowly
    'What do you want' you scream
    'You must pay for your transgressions' says the stranger in a lowly growl
    You quickly grab the clock off the fireplace and you charge the stranger
    You swing with all your strength aiming for his head
    But he is too fast, he side steps your attemp
    and cracks you across the head with the blackjack
    You pass out
    You awake and find a bloody blade in your hand
    You throw it across the floor, your hand is covered in blood
    You look up and scan the room, you see Emily on the floor
    She is covered in blood
    The door opens and Emilys father walks in
    'What in the seven hells have you done' he shouts
    *Crack*
    You awake with a splitting headache, you are back in the forest clearing
    Your tied up against the tree
    5 men looking down on you
    You recognise Emilys father Pierre
    'You thought you could runaway' he says
    'Now you will die for what you did to my daughter'
    'Do you have any last words {username} ?'
    As you open your mouth to protest Pierre slashes our throat
    You bleed to death tied to the tree
